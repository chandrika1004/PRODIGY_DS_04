# PRODIGY_DS_04
This repository contains Task-04 of the Data Science Internship under Prodigy InfoTech. In this task I worked on analyzing and visualizing sentiment patterns from Twitter data. I cleaned the data, categorized tweet as positive, negative or neutral and visualized the results using bar charts and word clouds. It was a great way to learn how social media data can show public opinion.
